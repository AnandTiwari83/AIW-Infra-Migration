## HOL3: Exercise 7: Business case analysis capability (Read-only)

In this exercise, you'll learn how to create a business case for Azure, using a free Azure Migrate feature during assessments that will help simplify your move to Azure.

Managing your on-premises data centres can present time-bound challenges such as expiring contracts, ageing hardware, and end-of-support software. You may also be under pressure to address cash flow challenges, add capacity, and prevent security attacks while ensuring business continuity.

To understand if Azure makes financial sense, we will start by creating a directional business case with Azure Migrate. This helps you understand what the best migration strategy is for your business and how to gradually move from a capital expenditure model to an operating expenditure model where you only pay for what you use.

**Business case analysis** is a comprehensive, easy-to-use tool that enables customers and partners to create directional business proposals to understand how Azure can bring the most value to their business.

> **Note:** You don't need to perform this task as it is a read-only exercise.

**Features:**

- Need **minimal inputs** to get started.

- Includes **migration strategy recommendation** including lift-and-shift to IaaS and modernize to PaaS.

- Highlights **on-premises TCO, ROI** and financial analysis, **resource utilization-based insights and quick wins**.

- Enables creating **what-if** scenarios with customizable settings and assumptions.

9. On the **Potential savings** blade, observe the cost. It represents an estimated on-premises cost versus Azure TCO and the potential savings possible by getting rid of components that you'll no longer need.

10. The **YoY estimated current vs future state cost** presents a year-over-year cost breakdown of the estimated current versus future state.

12. Based on the rich data insights collected during the discovery process, on **Recommended migration strategy blade** you can observe how to effectively migrate to Azure, which underutilized servers to the right size, and which unused servers to potentially decommission.

16. Given the importance of what-if scenarios and customizations in the planning process, use new settings to override default assumptions and build a business case for your migration strategy. We can present this business case to your stakeholders obtain buy-ins and know that you've taken the steps to make the right decisions for your business.
