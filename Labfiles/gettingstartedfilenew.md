# Infrastructure Migration

## Overall Estimated Duration: 8 hours  

## Overview 

In these hands-on labs, you'll migrate and modernize workloads to Azure. You'll start by evaluating and migrating Windows and SQL Server workloads using Azure Migrate and Azure Site Recovery. Next, you'll replicate and migrate a Red Hat VM and OSS DB workloads, enabling Azure AD-based login and connecting to Azure Automanage. Finally, you'll manage a Windows machine with Azure Arc, using Azure Site Recovery for disaster recovery, including test failovers and failovers to Azure VMs.

## Objective

**Evaluate and Plan Migration:** Assess your current environment using Azure Migrate, create migration assessments, and configure dependency visualization to ensure a smooth transition.

**Set Up Azure Environment:** Prepare Azure for migration by creating storage accounts, registering Hyper-V hosts, enabling replication, and configuring networking.

**Migrate Workloads:** Use Azure Migrate and Azure Site Recovery to migrate Windows, SQL Server, Linux, and OSS DB workloads, ensuring minimal downtime and leveraging Azure's scalability.

**Optimize Workloads:** Enhance the performance and resilience of migrated workloads using VM Scale Sets, Azure Automanage, and Azure Active Directory for Linux.

**Disaster Recovery and Security:** Implement disaster recovery plans with Azure Site Recovery, conduct test failovers, and enable failovers to Azure VMs. Enhance security with Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Microsoft Sentinel, and Azure Monitor.

**Governance and Business Analysis:** Apply Azure governance practices and perform business case analysis to ensure compliance and optimize resource management.

## Architecture

This diagram shows the process of migrating an on-premises SQL Server database to Azure SQL Managed Instance (SQL MI). It involves setting up SQL MI, assessing the database for compatibility issues, migrating data using Azure Data Migration Service (DMS), configuring a secure virtual network, deploying the web application to Azure, and enabling advanced SQL MI features for optimized performance and security.

## Explanation of Components

- **Visual Studio**: Used to deploy and publish the customerâ€™s web application to Azure. It supports continuous development and integration practices, enabling developers to push updates to the cloud-hosted web app that interacts with SQL MI.

- **SQL Server Configuration Manager**: A vital tool for managing SQL Server services, network configurations, and server-specific settings. It is primarily used to control the behavior of SQL Server instances and related services.

- **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio**: A comprehensive tool for managing SQL Server infrastructure. It provides a user-friendly interface for connecting, querying, configuring, and managing SQL Server databases both on-premises and in the cloud.

3. If you have not extended the duration prior to when the lab is about to end, a pop-up will appear, giving you the option to extend. Click **OK** to proceed.

## Let's Get Started with Azure Portal
 
1. On your virtual machine, click on the Azure Portal icon as shown below:
 
    ![Launch Azure Portal](Images/azureportal.png)

2. You'll see the **Sign into Microsoft Azure** tab. Here, enter your credentials:
 
   - **Email/Username:** <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
 
     ![Enter Your Username](Images/sc900-image-1.png)
 
3. Next, provide your password:
 
   - **Password:** <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>
 
     ![Enter Your Password](Images/sc900-image-2.png)
 
4. If prompted to stay signed in, you can click "No."
 
5. If a **Welcome to Microsoft Azure** pop-up window appears, simply click "Maybe Later" to skip the tour.
   
6. Now you will see the Azure Portal Dashboard, click on **Resource groups** from the Navigate panel to see the resource groups.
