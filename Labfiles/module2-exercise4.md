## HOL2: Exercise 4: Optimizing newly migrated workloads, and emphasizing commonalities across all stacks

### Task 1: Getting Started with Azure Active Directory for Linux 

In this task, you will be enabling the AAD authentication using a VM extension and enabling Managed identity. 

1. In the Azure portal `https://portal.azure.com`, Navigate to your newly migrated **redhat** VM and select it.

### Task 2: Leveraging SSH to connect and authenticate Linux Servers on Azure 

To improve the security of Linux virtual machines in Azure, you can integrate with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. You can now use Azure AD as a core authentication platform and a certificate authority to SSH into a Linux VM by using Azure AD and OpenSSH certificate-based authentication. This functionality allows organizations to manage access to VMs with Azure role-based access control (RBAC) and Conditional Access policies.

In this task, we are using Azure CloudShell to configure a Linux VM and log in with Azure AD by using OpenSSH certificate-based authentication.

1. In the Azure portal `https://portal.azure.com`, select the Azure Cloud Shell icon from the top menu.

   ![The Azure Cloud Shell icon is highlighted in the Azure portal's top menu.](Images/cloud-shell-icon.png "Azure Cloud Shell")

2. In the Cloud Shell window that opens at the bottom of your browser window, select **PowerShell**.

   ![In the Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell window, PowerShell is highlighted.](Images/cloud-shell-select-powershell.png "Azure Cloud Shell")

3. If prompted about not having a storage account mounted, click on **Show advanced settings**. Select Create new under Storage account and provide values as below: 
  
      - **Resource Group**: Select **Use existing** then select **SmartHotelRG**
      - **Storage account** : **storage<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**
      - **File Share** : **blob**

   ![This is a screenshot of the cloud shell opened in a browser window. Powershell was selected.](Images/b4-image36.png "Azure Cloud Shell")

4. After a moment, a message is displayed that you have successfully requested a Cloud Shell, and you are presented with a PS Azure prompt.

   ![In the Azure Cloud Shell dialog, a message is displayed that requesting a Cloud Shell succeeded, and the PS Azure prompt is displayed.](Images/cloud-shell-ps-azure-prompt.png "Azure Cloud Shell")
   
5. At the prompt, login to the azure by entering the following PowerShell command.

     ```
     az login
     ```
  
    > **Note:** Copy the login URL and enter the unique code in the browser. After that pick your account and click on **Continue** under Are you trying to sign in to Microsoft Azure CLI?
  
     ![](Images/azlogin.png)
   
6. Run the following commands to connect to the VM by using the name and resource group of the VM:

      ```
      az ssh vm -n redhat -g SmartHotelRG
      ```
  

### Task 3: Azure auto manage

In this task, you will Enable Automanage on existing machines.

1. If you are not logged in already, click on the Azure portal shortcut that is available on the desktop and log in with below Azure credentials.
    * Azure Username/Email: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject> 
    * Azure Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

2. In the search bar, search for and select **Automanage**.

3. Under **Automanage machines (1)**, select the **+ Enable on existing machine (2)**.

5. On the Select **machines blade**:

   a. Filter the list by your Subscription and Resource group and click on **Check eligibility on machines (2)**.
   
   b. Check the checkbox of **redhat (1)** virtual machine.
   
   c. Click the **Review + Create (3)** button.

6. Click on **Create**.

7. Once the Configuration profile assignment is completed successfully, it will take around 20-30 minutes to get the Status as Conformant.
