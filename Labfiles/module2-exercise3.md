## HOL2: Exercise 3: Migrating your apps and your data, leveraging Microsoft services and tools like Azure Migrate, the Azure Hybrid Benefit, and other tools and programs. 

### Task 1: Register the Hyper-V Host with Migration and modernization

In this task, you will review the already registered Hyper-V host(LabVM) with the Migration and modernization service. This service uses Azure Site Recovery as the underlying migration engine. As part of the registration process, we have already deployed the Azure Site Recovery Provider on your Hyper-V host in HOL1 and we will be using the same here as well.

1. Return to the **Azure Migrate** blade in the Azure Portal, and select **Servers, databases and web apps** under **Migration goals** on the left. 

2. Under Migration and Modernization, you should be able to see 7 discovered servers. Now click on the **Discovered servers** to view all the servers that have been discovered with the help of Azure Migrate.

#### Task summary 

In this task, you get an overview of your registered Hyper-V host with the Azure Migrate Server Migration service.

### Task 2: Enable Replication from Hyper-V to Azure Migrate

In this task, you will configure and enable the replication of your on-premises virtual machine from Hyper-V to the Azure Migrate Server Migration service.

1. Return to the Azure Migrate | Servers, databases and web apps blade and under **Migration and modernization**, select **Replicate**. This opens the **Replicate** wizard.

    ![Screenshot highlighting the 'Replicate' button in the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration' panel of the Azure Migrate - Servers blade.](Images/HOL2-EX3-T2-S1.png "Replicate link")
   
2. Under the **Specific Intent** page, provide the below details:

    -  What do you want to migrate? : Select **Servers or Virtual machines (VM)** **(1)**
    -  Where do you want to migrate to? : Select **Azure VM** **(2)**
    -  Click on **Continue (3)**

        ![](Images/specifi%20intent.png)

3. In the **Basics settings** tab, under **Are your machines virtualized?**, select **Yes, with Hyper-V** from the drop-down. Then select **Next**.

    ![Screenshot of the 'Source settings' tab of the 'Replicate' wizard in Azure Migrate Server Migration. Hyper-V replication is selected.](Images/upd-replicate-2.png "Replicate - Source settings")

4. In the **Virtual machines** tab, under **Import migration settings from an assessment**, select **Yes, apply migration settings from an Azure Migrate assessment (1)**. Select the **SmartHotel VMs (2)** VM group and the **SmartHotelAssessment (3)** migration assessment.

    ![Screenshot of the 'Virtual machines' tab of the 'Replicate' wizard in Azure Migrate Server Migration. The Azure Migrate assessment created earlier is selected.](Images/upd-replicate-3.png "Replicate - Virtual machines")

5. The **Virtual machines** tab should now show the virtual machines included in the assessment. Select the **redhat (1)** virtual machine, then select **Next (2)**.

    ![Screenshot of the 'Virtual machines' tab of the 'Replicate' wizard in Azure Migrate Server Migration. The UbuntuWAF, smarthotelweb1, and smarthotelweb2 machines are selected.](Images/upd-migrateredhat.png "Replicate - Virtual machines")

6. On the **Target settings** tab, select the below information,
   - Select your subscription and the existing **SmartHotelRG (1)** resource group. 
   - **Cache storage account**: Select the storage account that has been created in the previous HOL1 **(2)**.
   - **Virtual Network**: Select **SmartHotelVNet (3)**. 
   - **Subnet**: Select **SmartHotel (4)**. 
   - Select **Next (5)**.
 
        ![Screenshot of the 'Target settings' tab of the 'Replicate' wizard in Azure Migrate Server Migration. The resource group, storage account and virtual network created earlier in this exercise are selected.](Images/hol2-ex-3-T2-s6.png)

   > **Note:** For simplicity, in this lab you will not configure the migrated VM for high availability, since each application tier is implemented using a single VM.

7. On the **Compute** tab, select the below configuration,
   - Select the **Standard_F2s_v2** VM size for each virtual machine. 
   - Select the **Linux** operating system for the **redhat** virtual machine. 
   - Select **Next**. 

        ![Screenshot of the 'Compute' tab of the 'Replicate' wizard in Azure Migrate Server Migration. Each VM is configured to use a Standard_F2s_v2 SKU, and has the OS Type specified.](Images/upd-HOL2-EX3-T2-S6.png "Replicate - Compute")
    

8. In the **Disks** tab, review the settings but do not make any changes. Select **Next: Tags**, then select **Replicate** to start the server replication.

9. In the **Azure Migrate - Servers, databases and web apps** blade, under **Migration and modernization**, select the **Overview** button.

    ![Screenshot of the 'Azure Migrate - Servers' blade with the 'Overview' button in the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration' panel highlighted.](Images/nwoverview.png "Overview link")
    
10. Confirm that the **1** machine is replicating.

    ![Screenshot of the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration' overview blade showing the replication state as 'Healthy' for 3 servers.](Images/Replication4.png "Replication summary")

11. Select **Replications (1)** under **Manage** on the left. Select **Refresh (2)** occasionally and wait until the redhat machine has a **Protected (3)** status, which shows the initial replication is complete. This will take 5-10 minutes.

    ![Screenshot of the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration - Replicating machines' blade showing the replication status as 'Protected' for all 3 servers.](Images/infra1.10.png "Replication status")


#### Task summary 

In this task, you enabled replication from the Hyper-V host to Azure Migrate and configured the replicated VM size in Azure.

### Task 3: Configure Networking

In this task, you will modify the settings for each replicated VM to use a static private IP address that matches the on-premises IP addresses for that machine.

1. Still using the **Migration and modernization - Replications** blade, select the **redhat** virtual machine. This opens a detailed migration and replication blade for this machine. Take a moment to study this information.

    ![Screenshot from the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration - Replicating machines' blade with the smarthotelweb1 machine highlighted.](Images/infra1.11.png "Replicating machines")

2. Select **Compute and Network (1)** under **General** on the left, then select **Edit (2)**.

    ![Screenshot of the smarthotelweb1 blade with the 'Compute and Network' and 'Edit' links highlighted.](Images/upd-editcnfredhat.png "Edit Compute and Network settings")

3. Confirm that the VM is configured to use the **F2s_v2** VM size.

4. Under **Network Interfaces**, select **AzureMigrateSwitch** to open the network interface settings.

    ![Screenshot showing the link to edit the network interface settings for a replicated VM.](Images/HOL2-EX3-T3-S5.png "Network Interface settings link")

5. Change the **Private IP address** to **192.168.0.19**

    ![Screenshot showing a private IP address being configured for a replicated VM in ASR.](Images/upd-smarupdateprivate.png "Network interface - static private IP address")

6. Select **OK** to close the network interface settings blade, then **Save** the **redhat** settings to configure the private IP address for the VM.


#### Task summary 

In this task, you modified the settings for each replicated VM to use a static private IP address that matches the on-premises IP addresses for that machine

> **Note**: Azure Migrate makes a "best guess" at the VM settings, but you have full control over the settings of migrated items. In this case, setting a static private IP address ensures the virtual machine in Azure retains the same IPs they had on-premises, which avoids having to reconfigure the VM during migration (for example, by editing web.config files).

### Task 4: Server migration

In this task, you will perform a migration of the redhat virtual machine to Azure.

> **Note**: In a real-world scenario, you would perform a test migration before the final migration. To save time, you will skip the test migration in this lab. The test migration process is very similar to the final migration.

1. Return to the **Migration and modernization** overview blade. Under **Step 3: Migrate**, select **Migrate more servers**.

    ![Screenshot of the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration' overview blade, with the 'Migrate' button highlighted.](Images/infra1.12.png "Replication summary")

1. On the **Specify Intent** blade, select **Azure VM (1)** for **Where do you want to migrate to?** and click on **Continue (2)**

    ![Screenshot of the 'Migrate' blade, with 3 machines selected and the 'Migrate' button highlighted.](Images/infra1.6.png "Migrate - VM selection")

2. On the **Migrate** blade, select **yes (1)** for **Shutdown machines before migration to minimum data loss** and select the **redhat (2)** virtual machine then select **Migrate (3)** to start the migration process.

    ![Screenshot of the 'Migrate' blade, with 3 machines selected and the 'Migrate' button highlighted.](Images/upd-starmigrationredhat.png "Migrate - VM selection")

   > **Note**: You can optionally choose whether the on-premises virtual machine should be automatically shut down before migration to minimize data loss. Either setting will work for this lab.

3. The migration process will start.

    ![Screenshot showing 3 VM migration notifications.](Images/upd-Migration3.png "Migration started notifications")

4. To monitor progress, select **Jobs (1)** under **Manage** on the left and review the status of the redhat **Planned failover (2)** job.

    ![Screenshot showing the **Jobs* link and a jobs list with 3 in-progress 'Planned failover' jobs.](Images/infra1.13.png "Migration jobs")

5. **Wait** until the **Planned failover** jobs show a **Status** of **Successful**. You should not need to refresh your browser. This could take up to 15 minutes.

    ![Screenshot showing the **Jobs* link and a jobs list with all 'Planned failover' jobs successful.](Images/infra1.14.png "Migration status")

6. Navigate to the **SmartHotelRG** resource group and check that the VM, network interface, and disk resource have been created for the redhat virtual machine being migrated.

    ![Screenshot showing resources created by the test failover (VMs, disks, and network interfaces).](Images/upd-redhatrg.png "Migrated resources")

#### Task summary 

In this task, you used Azure Migrate to create Azure VM using the settings you have configured, and the data replicated from the Hyper-V machine. This migrated your on-premises VM to Azure.
